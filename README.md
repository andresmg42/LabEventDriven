**Project**

- **Description**: This repository provides an event-driven microservices demo using Apache Kafka, Docker Compose for local orchestration, and Kubernetes manifests + helper scripts for deploying the services into a cluster.

- **Goal**: Show how services produce/consume Kafka topics and how to add more microservices into this infra.

**Repository Structure**

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Local composition of the full stack (Zookeeper, Kafka, a `kafka-init` helper that creates topics, and the example `user-service`). Used for local development and to create topics locally.
- **`k8s/`**: Kubernetes manifests and helper scripts used to create images and deploy services to a cluster.
  - **`k8s/services/`**: Kubernetes YAML files. Current files: `kafka.yml`, `zookeeper.yml`, `kafka-init.yml`, `user-service.yml`, `namespace.yml`. Add new microservice manifests here (one file per service).
  - **`k8s/scripts/`**: Bash scripts used to build images and control the environment:
    - `init.sh` — builds/creates docker images and any preparation needed for deployment.
    - `start-services.sh` — applies `k8s/services/*.yml` to start services in Kubernetes and creates `kubectl port-forward` entries for local access.
    - `delete-services.sh` — removes Kubernetes resources created for services.
    - `delete-images.sh` — removes docker images used by services (clean up local images after tests).
- **`user-service/`**: Example microservice (producer) used by the demo.
  - `Dockerfile` — image build instructions for the user-service.
  - `index.js` — service source (node app).
  - `package.json` — node dependencies and scripts.

**Important files and what they do**

- `docker-compose.yml`: starts `zookeeper`, `kafka`, `kafka-init` (topic creation job) and `user-service`. When adding a new service for local testing, add it under the `services:` section here.
- `k8s/services/kafka-init.yml`: this YAML contains the container/entrypoint that runs `kafka-topics` commands to create the topics needed. Add your topic creation command here so the cluster init creates your topic automatically.
- `k8s/services/<your-service>.yml`: Kubernetes `Deployment` + `Service` for your microservice. Add one file per microservice in this folder.
- `k8s/scripts/init.sh`: script to build your docker image(s). Add the `docker build`/`docker push` (if you use a registry) commands for your service here.
- `k8s/scripts/start-services.sh`: script that runs `kubectl apply -f k8s/services/<your-service>.yml` for your service and sets up a `kubectl port-forward` so you can access it locally. Add the command here for your service.
- `k8s/scripts/delete-images.sh`: script that removes images used in the environment. Add the name (or `docker rmi` commands) for your image so the cleanup removes it.

**How to add a new microservice — Step by step**

1) Create your microservice folder

- Create a folder at repository root called `./<your-service>` (example: `./order-service`). Put your service code there.
- Add a `Dockerfile` to that folder. Minimal Node.js example:

```powershell
# from repo root
cd .\order-service
docker build -t myusername/order-service:latest .
```

2) Add your service to `docker-compose.yml` (for local development)

- Under the `services:` block in `docker-compose.yml` add an entry similar to the example below (adjust ports, environment and names):

```yaml
  order-service:
    build:
      context: ./order-service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: order-service
    ports:
      - "3002:3001"
    environment:
      - KAFKA_BROKER=kafka:29092
      - SERVICE_NAME=order-service
    networks:
      - microservices-net
    depends_on:
      kafka-init:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
      kafka:
        condition: service_healthy
```

3) Create Kubernetes manifest in `k8s/services/`

- Add `k8s/services/order-service.yml` (or `order-service.yml`) with a Deployment and a Service. Example minimal manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: order-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: order-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: order-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: order-service
        image: myusername/order-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3001
        env:
        - name: KAFKA_BROKER
          value: "kafka:29092"

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: order-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    app: order-service
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 3001
    targetPort: 3001
  type: ClusterIP
```

4) Add your Kafka topic in `k8s/services/kafka-init.yml`

- Open `k8s/services/kafka-init.yml` (or the `kafka-init` entry in `docker-compose.yml` for local compose) and add a `kafka-topics --create --if-not-exists --topic <your-topic> --partitions <n> --replication-factor 1` command.

- Example (the `kafka-init` container in `docker-compose.yml` runs a shell that contains `kafka-topics` commands). Add a line like:

```sh
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --create --if-not-exists --topic order-events --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```

5) Register image creation in `k8s/scripts/init.sh`

- Edit `k8s/scripts/init.sh` and add the `docker build` command that creates your microservice image. If you push to a remote registry (recommended for remote K8s clusters), add `docker push` after tagging the image.

Example additions:

```bash
echo "Building order-service image"
docker build -t myusername/order-service:latest ./order-service
# optionally push if using a registry
docker push myusername/order-service:latest
```

Note: `k8s/scripts/init.sh` is a bash script — run it in WSL, Git Bash or a Unix shell on CI.

6) Add start/apply commands to `k8s/scripts/start-services.sh`

- Edit `k8s/scripts/start-services.sh` to apply the new manifest and create a port-forward so you can access the service locally. Example lines to add:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/services/order-service.yml
# Wait for pods to be ready (optional)
kubectl -n default rollout status deployment/order-service --timeout=120s
# Port-forward so team members can access the service locally
kubectl -n default port-forward service/order-service 3002:3001 &
```

7) Add image cleanup in `k8s/scripts/delete-images.sh`

- Add your image to the cleanup script so that `delete-images.sh` removes `myusername/order-service:latest` when cleaning the environment.

Example line to add:

```bash
docker rmi -f myusername/order-service:latest || true
```

8) (Optional) Remove K8s resources in `k8s/scripts/delete-services.sh`

- If the repository has a `delete-services.sh`, add `kubectl delete -f k8s/services/order-service.yml` so the service can be removed cleanly.

9) Test everything locally

- Start kafka + zookeeper + topic creation + local services:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

- Or, build your image and run locally:

```powershell
docker build -t myusername/order-service:latest ./order-service
docker run --rm -e KAFKA_BROKER=kafka:29092 -p 3002:3001 myusername/order-service:latest
```

- To deploy on a Kubernetes cluster (after building/pushing image and updating `k8s/services/order-service.yml`):

```powershell
# run init.sh to build and (optionally) push images
bash k8s/scripts/init.sh

# apply k8s resources
bash k8s/scripts/start-services.sh
```

10) PR checklist for your team member

- Add the service folder with code and `Dockerfile`.
- Update `docker-compose.yml` with a development service entry.
- Add `k8s/services/<your-service>.yml` and verify the `image:` points to the image created in `init.sh`.
- Add topic creation to `k8s/services/kafka-init.yml`.
- Add `docker build` (and `docker push` if needed) to `k8s/scripts/init.sh`.
- Add `kubectl apply` and `kubectl port-forward` lines to `k8s/scripts/start-services.sh`.
- Add `docker rmi` or image name to `k8s/scripts/delete-images.sh` for cleanup.
- Add a short README in your service folder explaining how to run the service locally and the endpoints it exposes.

Notes and repository-specific clarifications

- The repo uses `k8s/services/` and `k8s/scripts/*.sh` (bash) — prefer editing those files, not new folders named `ks8` or `microservices` (typos seen in some instructions). Use `k8s/services/` for YAMLs and `k8s/scripts/` for the helper scripts.
- `k8s/scripts/*` are bash scripts; on Windows use WSL, Git Bash, or run them in CI (Linux) to avoid shell incompatibilities.
